### Hi there 👋

My name is Anthony and I am a professional software engineer!

🔭 I’m currently working on a portfolio website in its early stages which you can find [here](https://github.com/anthonycella/Anthony-Cella)

🏔 Some previous work:
- [Predicting Parkinson's](https://github.com/anthonycella/predicting_parkinsons) a machine learning algorithm designed to predict parkinson's disease in patients.
- [Vroom](https://github.com/anthonycella/Vroom) a rideshare app created as a part of a team to decrease road trip costs.
- [Noogle Translate](https://github.com/anthonycella/Noogle-Translate) a mix between Stack Overflow and official documentation: users can search for a topic and find a tutorial in several different languages, allowing software engineers to learn new languages more quickly.
